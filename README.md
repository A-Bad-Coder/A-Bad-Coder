## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
Im just a normal kid (possibly like you) who took up coding
Im awful and I know it, but I try my best :P
W3schools is my GOAT, tysm for helping me learn to code
I know HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP
HTML is my strongest language, with CSS at a close second.
I just started learning PHP, wish me luck (lmao)
TY Love ya'll <3! (Platonically)
