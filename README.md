## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im just a normal kid (possibly like you) who took up coding <br>
Im awful and I know it, but I try my best :P <br>
W3schools is my GOAT, tysm for helping me learn to code <br>
I know HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP
HTML is my strongest language, with CSS at a close second. <br>
I just started learning PHP, wish me luck (lmao) <br>
TY Love ya'll <3! (Platonically) <br>
